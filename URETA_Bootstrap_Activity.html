                    <h3>Skill 1: Playing the Guitar</h3>
                    <p>During the pandemic, I initally attempted learning the ukulele to hone my string instrument skills. Eventually, as I mastered that instrument, I shifted to guitar, that until now is what I am fond of playing with my preferential yet occassional music choice.  </p>

                    <h3>Skill 2: Singing </h3>
                    <p>Since I was 6 years old, I have been fond of singing as my daily habit and hobby. I would post song covers on social media for fun while accompanying it with guitar arrangements. Although I have never taken singing classes, I look forward to doing that someday in the future. </p>

                    <h3>Skill 3: Crocheting</h3>
                    <p>Rooted and inspired by my fourth grade TLE teacher, I developed an interest in crocheting figures such as small animals, bows, and anything I find intriguing. Back in tenth grade, I made a small crochet business and estabished it, catering to my classmates and batchmates. Luckily, I did earn an amount of money, however it was tiresome given that the price i set per piece was low.  </p>

                    <h3>Skill 4: Swimming </h3>
                    <p>As one of my forbidden sports that I could have cultivated since, swimming is one that I can say I excel in. This started when I took formal swimming classes back in fourth grade, overall developing my keen skills. Until now, the idea that I could have owned up to the sport still stikes on my mind.  </p>

                    <p>I am Mikaela Denise Ureta, currently 17 years old and studying at APC College. Upon getting to know me, I believe I'm silly and energetic person to be around, while being logical in serious times. I'm somehow academically conscious, therefore I may seem studious for some. Given all that, I am an individual who values her principles and persevere to attaining a good conduct, overall to make life honestly easier and more peaceful.  </p>

                    <h2>Portfolio</h2>
                    <p>Included in some of my proud achievements are the awards I attained in my tenth grade completion rites. As a fruit of my restless days, I got to bring both of my parents on stage, and gladly savored the honorable moment. Although I do not humbly declare myself as a student achiever, this is one of the happiest and proudest memories embedded in my life.  </p>
